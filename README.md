# Petgram

This is a pet photo app where you can find photos of your favorite pets.

It is a project is a **PWA** created with the following technologies and the best practices:

-**React**
-**Styled Components**
-**GraphQl**
-**Webpack**
-**Reach Router**
-**React.Context**

It has a backend within the path `./api`, however it does not have a database so that the information persists, that is a **TO DO** that I will give priority to soon.

You can enter the project from [https://petgram-nu-five.now.sh/](https://petgram-nu-five.now.sh/'), if you do a "Log In" you should try the app quickly because your token and your user do not stay long on the server because we don't have a data base.
